# comp-311-assembly-practice-problems

This respository contains various exercises for learning the RISC-V instruction set architecture. Each exercise will contain an unanswered problem and a filled in solution. The exercises will follow the course strucutre of COMP 311; if the exercise requires actions that have not been taught yet in class the code will be provided. I encourage you to explore the code that hasn't yet been taught and see if you can figure out what it does and why it does it that way. This repository will go outside the expected knowledge for the course and push you to engage at a deeper level with the RISC-V ISA!

## Setting up your environment

This set of practice problems is intended to be run in RARS 1.6 using other editors may result in unexpected behavior. <br/>
The RARS download can be found in the root readme of their github page: https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars <br/>
**Make sure you have Java runtime installed**
